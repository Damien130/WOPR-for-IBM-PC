# WOPR-for-IBM-PC
A WOPR control panel for the IBM PC (/XT)'s full height 5.25 inch drive bay

Why WOPR?
WOPR, acronym for War Operation Plan Response, is a supercomputer in the 80s movie War Games. Other than its inherent purpose of planning to start a global thermonuclear war and constant drive to play a good game of chess, it also has lots, lots of LEDs flashing all around it. Although the 5150/60 Personal Computers bears little resemblance to WOPR itself, the WOPR’s control panel will fit right into the IBM beige box design of the 80s. 
What will it look like?
The purpose of this design project is to replicate part of WOPR’s main control panel to fit inside a full-height 5.25-inch drive bay of the IBM 5160 PC/XT. The panel will consist of 16 LEDs, a push button to generate a reset signal to the P8284A clock generator, a “Turbo Switch” to select between 4.77 MHz and 7.2 MHz clock frequency for the NEC V20 Processor (CMOS/improved version of Intel 8088 with 80186/286 instruction support) and on/off switch for the entire LED panel.
